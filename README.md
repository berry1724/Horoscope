Leo people are very ambitious and they always want to stand out with their efforts, yearning for the superiority complex and being admired; they are a little overly confident and pretentious.

Librans are very sincere, so they often have many true friends. The biggest weakness of Librans is that they are always indecisive. Male Librans tend to care about themselves but ignore others while the female Librans would like to have someone accompanying them.")

            print("Scorpio is the eighth sign of the Zodiac indicated by a Scorpion. People under the Scorpio sign are vigorous and possessive; they have clear goals in life and will not stop until they reach their goals. Scorpions pay great attention to personal privacy and they are so revenge-minded that they will revenge on those how have hurt them desperately. Male Scorpions have strong egoism color while female Scorpions have strong self-protection awareness and they are unapproachable.")

People born on between January 20 and February 18 are under the Aquarius sign. Aquarians are basically forward-thinking, rational and self-respecting. Similar with the Sagittarians, they are philanthropic and unrestrained but they are different with the Sagittarians. Ruled by the Uranus, Aquarians often give people the intelligent, humorous and unique feeling but they are seemingly a contradictory combination: sometimes low-key, sometimes high-key; sometimes tender, sometimes indifferent; sometimes realistic, sometimes free from vulgarity. In short, people under Aquarius sign are complex and changeful.")
